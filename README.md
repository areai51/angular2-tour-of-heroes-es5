# angular2-tour-of-heroes-es5

*Still work in progress with only the dashboard page for now *
This is a port of the [Tour of Heroes Tutorial](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)  in ES5.
Simply extract the files and run index.html from within a web server and it should work.
No Node no TypeScript.

*The purpose of this ES5 version is only to help you understand Angular2 without being overwhelmened with the new syntaxes of TypeScript. 
But once you get comfortable you should immediately switch to TypeScript for all the awesomeness it brings to the table!!*
